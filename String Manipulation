/* Find the Length of a String

You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

"Alan Peter".length; // 10

For example, if we created a variable var firstName = "Charles", we could find out how long the string "Charles" is by using 
the firstName.length property. */

// Example 1
var firstNameLength = 0;
var firstName = "Ada";

firstNameLength = firstName.length;

// Example 2

// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

lastNameLength = lastName;
lastNameLength = lastName.length;

/* Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String
Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 
like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word "Charles" is "C". So if var firstName = "Charles", you can 
get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0]. */

// First letter of first name
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// First letter of last name
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName [0];
