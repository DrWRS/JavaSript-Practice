/* Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays
With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing 
square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:  var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"]. */

// Example of an array containing string and numeric data

var myArray = ["Marijuana", 420];

/* Nest one Array within Another Array
You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like this: [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]]. This is also called a 
Multi-dimensional Array. */

// Example 1
var ourArray = [["the universe", 42], ["everything", 101010]];

// Example 2
var myArray = [["Marijuan", 420], ["Poker", 415]];
