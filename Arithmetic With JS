/* Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.
Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.
JavaScript uses the + symbol as addition operation when placed between two numbers. */

var sum = 10 + 10;          // Simple addition = 20
var difference = 45 - 33;   // Simnple subtraction = 12
var product = 8 * 10;       // Simple multiplication = 80
var quotient = 66 / 33;     // Simple division = 2

/* You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.  
i++; is the equivalent of i = i + 1; 
Note - The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign. */

// Example of the ++ operator removing the = sign
var myVar = 87;

myVar = myVar++; // This will increment the myVar variable making it equal to 88
