Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false. They are basically little 
on-off switches, where true is "on" and false is "off." These two states are mutually exclusive.

Note
Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special 
meaning in JavaScript.

// Example 1

function welcomeToBooleans() {

//return false; // Change this line to return true instead of false

return true; // This will return a true boolean

}
