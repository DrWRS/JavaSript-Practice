/* Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.
Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.
JavaScript uses the + symbol as addition operation when placed between two numbers. */

var sum = 10 + 10;          // Simple addition = 20
var difference = 45 - 33;   // Simnple subtraction = 12
var product = 8 * 10;       // Simple multiplication = 80
var quotient = 66 / 33;     // Simple division = 2

/* You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.  
i++; is the equivalent of i = i + 1; 
Note - The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign. */

// Example of incrementation using the ++ operator removing the = sign
var myVar = 87;
myVar = myVar + 1;          // Instead of this use the next example
myVar++;                    // This will increment the myVar variable making it equal to 88

/* You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.
i--; is the equivalent of i = i - 1;
Note - The entire line becomes i--;, eliminating the need for the equal sign. */

// Example of decrementation using the -- operator removing the = sign
var myVar = 11;             
myVar = myVar - 1;           // Instead of this use the next example
myVar--;                     // This will decrease the myVar variable making it equal to 10

/* We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.
Note - Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. This can lead to rounding errors. Details Here. */

var myDecimal = 4.20;         // Decimal/Floating point number



// End of Simple arithmetic, incrementation, and decrementation
