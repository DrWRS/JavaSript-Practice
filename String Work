/* Previously we have used the code
var myName = "your name";
"your name" is called a string literal. 
It is a string because it is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes. */

// Example
var firstName = "Alan";
var lastName = "Turing";

/* When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you 
need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?  In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it 
as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote. 

var sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\"."; 

This signals to JavaScript that the following quote is not the end of the string, but should instead appear inside 
the string. So if you were to print this to the console, you would get:  Alan said, "Peter is learning JavaScript". */

var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" inside \"double quotes\".";  // this will print - I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".

/*  String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote. 
Unlike some other programming languages, single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript.

doubleQuoteStr = "This is a string"; 
singleQuoteStr = 'This is also a string';

The reason why you might want to use one type of quote over the other is if you want to use both in a string. 
This might happen if you want to save a conversation in a string and have the conversation in quotes. Another use for it would be 
saving an <a> tag with various attributes in quotes, all within a string. 

However, this becomes a problem if you need to use the outermost quotes within it. Remember, a string has the same kind of quote at 
the beginning and end. But if you have that same quote somewhere in the middle, the string will stop early and throw an error.
You can use both quotes safely by using the backslash \ as an escape character.Note - The backslash \ should not be be confused 
with the forward slash /. They do not do the same thing. */

var myStr = "<a href=\"http://www.example.com\" target=\"_blank\">Link</a>";  // This will not work

// Use this instead

var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';

/* Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. There are two reasons to use escaping characters: 
First is to allow you to use characters you might not otherwise be able to type out, such as a backspace. Second is to allow you
to represent multiple quotes in a string without JavaScript misinterpreting what you mean. We learned this in the previous challenge.

Code	Output:
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	backspace
\f	form feed

Note - that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash.
Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable myStr using escape sequences.

FirstLine
    \SecondLine
ThirdLine */

var myStr = 'FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine'; // This will display the example correctly as requested

// End of String examples
